00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.450
To exemplify this, I'm going to work with 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.030
my telephone and in this case I'm going to be working with chat. 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.060
GPT. I've used other generative AI applications, but I found this one to 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.890
be the most superior. The others work, but not as well as this. And I'm using 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.590
the free version. And when using the free version, as you can see, there's this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.630
icon here that looks like a headphone, and that's when you click and you ensure 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.700
that your keyboard is in the language that you're going to speak, in which in this case is going to 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.470
be English. If I was going to be swedish, then I have the swedish keyboard. 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.350
So this is an example of how it's going to go. I'm going to 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.550
ask then the generative AI application to help me with 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.120
a mail, which I would like to send to my professors because I 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.970
have a very unpleasant doctoral student colleague in my group who behaves quite 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.940
aggressively in seminars. So just follow the process. We'll just do a 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.670
few minutes so you get the hang of it. 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.170
You will be helping me to write a male, which is very conflict based 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.270
because of a situation that I have at work. I shall be speaking to you 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.770
and I'd like you to ask me questions one at a time so that you clearly 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.760
understand the situation before you actually construct the mail. Please 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.190
acknowledge that you've understood my instructions before we continue. 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.710
I understand your instructions. I'll ask questions one at a time to fully grasp the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.550
situation before helping you write the email. Let's get started. Could you tell me more about the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.250
conflict you're dealing with at work? So I'm a doctoral student, and 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.120
every second week we have doctoral seminars, and there is an individual among 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.980
the doctoral students who's extremely aggressive and unpleasant. When 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.780
we have these seminars, it creates a very negative and unpleasant environment. And 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.220
the professors, the people who are managing the seminar, they. 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.150
They. In a way, they don't encourage it, but they allow it, and that's not good. It creates a very 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.970
negative working environment. 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.330
I understand. It sounds like the aggressive behavior is affecting not only the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.160
environment, but also your experience at these seminars. To help me understand 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.060
better, can you tell me how this person's behavior specifically manifests during the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.420
seminars? In a seminar, of course, you want 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.130
your group to ask you challenging 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.810
questions, but in this particular case, he sometimes asks 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.130
questions in a really kind of aggressive tone, but more so 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.460
when I've been speaking, he makes hand signals, like he does this with his hand to 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.340
show that he thinks it smells like bullshit. For example, and it's very off 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.720
putting. And he deems what he does to be 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.740
linguistics and what we do to be not linguistics, and he can't support 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.350
us in our own arguments or challenges with relation to what we're doing. It's always 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.100
through his viewpoint about what linguistics is and what it isn't. 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.960
It sounds like his behavior is not only disrespectful, but also dismissive of 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.800
your field of work, which adds to the frustration. How have the professors responded to this 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.870
so far? Have they acknowledged the behavior at all, or do they seem to ignore it 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.610
entirely? My impression is that they 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.590
ignore it. I think they're not used to having this kind of character, and 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.360
they simply don't know what to do. But they are the people who are managing 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.600
the seminars. It's their responsibility to make sure that it's a positive 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.960
environment for everybody involved. 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.880
I see. So it feels like there's a lack of intervention from the professors, 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.170
and that's adding to the problem. Do you intend to address this issue directly with the 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.890
professors, or are you thinking of including the student in the conversation as 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.490
well? I'd like to send a mail to this doctoral 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.380
student as well as the professors, and I would like to cc it to the dean of the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.250
faculty and also to my union representative, because I'd 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.090
like to see an improvement on the situation that we have here. 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.500
Got it. Since this is a sensitive issue, how would you prefer to frame the tone 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.980
of the email? Do you want it to be direct and firm, or more 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.980
diplomatic and focused on resolving the issue collaboratively? Perhaps 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.020
a combination of both. I'd like you to be diplomatic, but I would like it to be firm, and I would 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.940
like it to be written in a tone that shows how serious 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.000
I find this problem to be and that it's not to be just combed over. Do you have a particular 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.960
outcome in mind? For example, would you like a change in how the seminars are conducted? An 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.310
apology or some other resolution? I'd like for 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.190
the preferences to. I'd like for the professors. You're very welcome. Let me know whenever 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.550
you're ready to continue, and I'll be here to assist you. 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.720
I haven't finished. I would like the professors to 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.450
address the situation in the next seminar so it's not veiled over. 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.570
I'd like it to be openly talked about. Nobody needs to apologize. But I'd like them to 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.320
ensure that it's expected that there will be a positive tone by that 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.760
student, but by, in fact, everybody. 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.550
That makes sense. You want a clear, open discussion to improve the seminar 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.030
environment without focusing on personal apologies, but ensuring a more 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.010
respectful tone from everyone. Are there any specific details or examples you'd like to include in 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.610
the email to highlight the behavior and its impact, or would you prefer to keep it more 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.510
general? Let's keep it more general. And you can 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.180
now go ahead and create a draft of the mail, which I will then 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.900
tweak. 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.140
Here's a draft of the email based on what we've discussed 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.250
addressing conduct in doctoral seminars. So then you got to see an example of how you can 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.100
have a conversation with a genai application. 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.160
Now there is a bit of a lag depending upon your Internet connection. Sometimes, as you 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.630
saw, it broke off and I had to not restart it, but I had to 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.350
continue it again. This will get faster, it will get 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.270
more human like. There's something with chat GPT called advanced voice 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.030
mode, which I believe a lot of users are going to get quite soon, 

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.710
and so it will become more human like. And remember, this is only at the time of making 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.370
this video. It's less than two years after chat GPT-3 was 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.260
launched. So in a very short space of time, quite a lot has happened. I 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:47.260
use this technique a lot to help me with my process, 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.460
my thinking process. So it's not, my focus is not necessarily on the 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.750
end product, but being able to put my thoughts 

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.420
into, articulate them, and they end up in words. Then when I get the 

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.300
document, I will then tweak it, change it. Maybe it's done 75% of the 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.050
work for me. I still have to own it and work with it and change it 

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.060
before I'm ready to send it off. Now what would be great is if you were to try this out in 

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.980
some capacity, either a problem or just a discussion. You might be 

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.730
want to plan a wedding, or you might want to create a video script, 

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.780
ask for a discussion and help, and then ask for a summation of what's been 

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:35.150
written, see how you find it. Good luck with that.
