00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.359
Large language models are not only large, but they're also

2
00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.200
general purpose. When we say that an LLM is

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.799
general purpose, we mean that the model has been trained on a wide

4
00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.485
variety of text data from the Internet, and it's designed to

5
00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:22.005
understand and generate human language in a broad and very

6
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.465
versatile manner. It's not specialized for just one thing.

7
00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:29.285
It's a multi talented language tool that can assist with many different

8
00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:31.810
jobs involving words and communication.

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.990
If you've worked with much machine learning before, you'd be familiar

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.510
with the tray with training a model for a specific test such as

11
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.815
classification or clustering. But with LLMs,

12
00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:47.895
the initial goal is to give the model a general understanding of knowledge

13
00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.635
and how language works so that it can be applied to more

14
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:55.441
specific tasks later on. We pretrain the model to

15
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.801
understand general language and solve many general purpose

16
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:02.241
problems. And then we can fine tune it to work

17
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:04.421
on specific tasks or industries.
