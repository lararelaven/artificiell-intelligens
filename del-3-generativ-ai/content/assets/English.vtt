In late 2022,
a relatively unknown corporation

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.400
called OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.159
It was launched as a free online platform
which swiftly garnered global attention,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.030
attracting over 100 million users
in just a few weeks.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.986
ChatGPT made AI mainstream
and user friendly for non-tech users.

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:26.276
In essence, it is a sophisticated chat bot
that allowed users

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.996
to generate text
for lots of specific user situations,

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.465
such as writing an email,
creating marketing hype, writing essays,

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:38.509
or writing the CEO's introduction
for a corporate annual report.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.145
Generative AI is also capable
of programming

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.529
and creating visuals, videos, and audio.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.000
Following on from Chat GPTs launch,
numerous AI solutions have been created.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.875
Each capable of generating one or more
of these forms of content,

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.366
but with different kinds of functionality.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.686
Large tech organizations
such as Microsoft, Google, Meta,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.199
as well as Anthropic and X.AI
are all main players in generative AI,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.419
which requires a large language model
known as an LLM for it to work.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.486
The creation
of these large language models

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.339
is a costly affair, often requiring
tens of millions of dollars,

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:26.470
so their development is restricted
to these financially robust organizations.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.886
Some, like Meta's Llama, are open source,
but most LLMs are proprietary.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.576
That is closed source,
but the source code is not shared

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.839
with the public
for anyone to look at or change.

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:49.500
They may, however, offer an API for a fee.

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:52.776
An API enables
different software applications

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.636
to communicate with each other.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.055
For general users like us,
there are both complementary

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:02.879
and premium versions
of ChatGPT or Microsoft's Copilot,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.819
allowing for different levels
of functionality.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.796
To utilize these generative AI tools,
users simply type a request

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.440
a prompt into a chat interface
and then await a response.

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:26.095
The quality of the user's prompt
directly influences the generated output,

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.839
which can then be further developed
until the user is satisfied.

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:34.339
The user can then tweak
and further fine tune the outputted text.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.490
Diffusion models are another category
of generative AI.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:53.279
These are created to generate images,
videos, and audio from textual prompts.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.766
These models are trained using
visual and auditory data

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.889
instead of textual information.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.785
Key players in this domain
include Midjourney, OpenAI's Dall-E,

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:07.619
and stability AI
with their open source Stable Diffusion.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.175
Moreover, text to video A.I.

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:14.309
generation is being advanced by firms
like Runway and Synesthesia,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.309
while entities like 11 Labs
and Speecify

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.955
are concentrating on audio generation.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.955
With the foundational technology
of these AI tools

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.115
made accessible by larger firms.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:30.389
A myriad of specialized AI applications
are being developed by small entities.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.860
This course provides you with key insights
about generative AI,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.126
about effective prompting techniques,
and about the many critical issues

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.490
associated with using them ethically,
responsibly, efficiently, and wisely.
